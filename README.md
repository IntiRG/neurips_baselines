# A Realistic Evaluation of Cross-Frequency Transfer Learning and Foundation Forecasting Models

In this repository we host the executions of statistical baselines for the evaluation of cross-frequency transfer learning models.

With this code we confirm observations from the forecasting community on the performance of some well-established CSTL models.

Please install the dependencies.
```bash
!pip install gluonts
!pip install utilsforecast
!pip install statsforecast
```

The experiment pipeline, evaluation code and execution of the statistical baselines is all contained in the following notebook:
```
